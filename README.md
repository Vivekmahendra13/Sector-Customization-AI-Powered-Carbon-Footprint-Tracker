# Sector-Customization-AI-Powered-Carbon-Footprint-Tracker

1. Sector-Wise Focus
	•	Agriculture: Tracks emissions from fertilizer usage, water consumption, and machinery.
	•	Industrial: Monitors energy consumption, production volume, and waste output.
	•	IT Sector: Measures server energy use, data transfer, and cooling requirements.
	•	Manufacturing: Assesses emissions from raw materials, machine operations, and energy use.
	•	Residential: Calculates household emissions from electricity, gas, and appliance usage.
	•	Transport: Tracks emissions from vehicle fuel use, distance traveled, and load efficiency.
